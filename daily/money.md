# Student's Questions about MONEY       
**Keith, do you think it is ok to lend money to friends or family members?**          
Well, I think, by and large, I think, it’s absolutely fine to lend money to friends or family members. I know some people have reservations about doing that, but for me friends and family members, when they are in need or if they need a helping hand, then, you know, I think we should be the first person to help them out. So, if a…., my brother or my sister asks for money, I would probably go ahead and lend it to them. Provided, I had enough money to do that, I mean, I wouldn’t put myself in debt and go into the red in order to help them by lending them money. So, it would have to be some money I had put away or put aside and then I were free to use and help them out. So, for me, I think it’s absolutely fine to do that.         
       
**Keith, is money everything for you?**             
OK, not at all, by no means, by no stretches of the imagination. Whilst, on the one hand, I think money is important, we need enough money to buy clothes and food and to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle and may be it’s nice to splash out every once in a while and treat yourself to something special, maybe, some clothes or something similar, but for me, certainly money is not everything. I think, there are many more important things in life, such as relationships with friends and family, enjoying the little things or the little moments in life. I know it’s a bit of a cliché, but smelling the flowers, a beautiful view, watching a funny moment where the kitten is rolling on the floor playing with the wool. Those are also very important things. So, whilst I think money is important, it’s not the most important thing for me.
