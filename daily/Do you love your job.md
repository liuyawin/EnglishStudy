Today we’re going to listen to Mike and Emily. Mike is **furious**. He’s been fired from his work. He comes home and talks about his story to Emily. Let’s listen to see why and how it happened. What does Mike decide to do after getting fired? Does he try to find another job in another company? Or does he decide to do something new?       
 
**Emily**: Hey Mike.    
**Michael**: Hello    
**Emily**: Oh, what’s wrong with you? Are you ok?    
**Michael**: Should I be really ok? I **got the sack**.    
**Emily**: What? You got the sack! But how? Have you done anything wrong?    
**Michael**: Offf I don’t know.    
**Emily**: What do you mean by I don’t know? Didn’t you talk to your boss?    
**Michael**: Of course I did. He called me into his room today and said…    
**Emily**: What exactly did he say?    
**Michael**: With his ridiculous voice, he said, “Mike, concerning your work performance during these two years, the board is not satisfied with your work attitude.” My work attitude Emily. Do you believe it? My work attitude! “So our company has decided to fire you.”    
**Emily**: Oh, seriously? What did you do then?    
**Michael**: You know **I was flabbergasted**. I knew that our company was **downsizing its employees**, but I couldn’t believe that I would be one of those fired ones.    
**Emily**: But as far as I know, you’ve always been doing well at work. I think there must be other reasons that they didn’t want to tell you.    
**Michael**: I don’t know. I have no idea.    
**Emily**: Do you remember the time **you inquired about your bonus**? They were having financial problems.    
**Michael**: Yeah, you’re right. Actually, due to the influence of **global economic recession** in our co- company, our products didn’t sell well.    
**Emily**: But it had nothing to do with you.    
**Michael**: And you know it’s not reasonable to **work overtime** without extra pay also my salary was remained the same for about one year even when my company was operating well.    
**Emily**: So it is clear enough that you haven’t been fired because of those reasons, they said. **It was nothing other than an excuse.** They are suffering from a financial crisis. Oh, how did you find this company, Michel?    
**Michael**: After University, **I was turned down by lots of companies** before **I was finally taken on by here**. I thought **it was a nine-to-five job**, but I had to work all hours almost every day, and my boss was constantly checking up on me to make sure I was hard at it.    
**Emily**: But I’m sure Mike, if they didn’t get you the sack, **you yourself would decide to hand in your notice**.    
**Michael**: You know when I’m thinking, I understand maybe **I wasn’t really cut out for this job**.    
**Emily**: Yeah, working all hours with a salary **next to nothing** is really hard. I mean, if you are well paid, it’ll be worth it. But if you’re low paid with no bonus, so why should you waste your time working there?    
**Michael**: Yeah, I think it’s **high time to run** my own business.    
**Emily**: Oh, that’s wonderful. Why didn’t you think about it earlier?
**Michael**: I don’t know; maybe I needed to be fired.    
**Emily**: I think **sedentary jobs** don’t suit you, Mike.    
**Michael**: Yeah, other than that, I’ll have job security if I become self-employed. I shouldn’t be worried about my salary, my working hours, and the most important one being fired.    
**Emily**: Yeah, you will be your own boss also an entrepreneur. You’ll have your own employees.     
**Michael**: Isn’t it good to start from you?    
**Emily**: Oh, I love my current job, but I promise to give you a hand in anything you need me.    
**Michael**: Oh, I’m so happy to have such a **considerate** friend like you, Emily.      
**Emily**: That’s very kind of you, Michel. I’m always **at your service**.     

**Did you enjoy listening to the story? Do you have similar experiences? I mean, have you ever given the sack? If yes, were you flabbergasted after it? Have you ever turned down by a company you dreamed of working for?**       
               
**Discussion Room**           
**Michael**: Hello everybody, this is Michel, and today we are here with Emily for another discussion room for you.        
**Emily**: Hello everyone, it is very nice to be here again.         

**To get the sack**      
**Michael**: Ok, let’s start our discussion room with a nice idiom. Are you ready, Emily?       
**Emily**: Yeah, I’m ready and excited.       
**Michael**: The idiom is ‘I got the sack’ Emily, could you please tell us its meaning?        
**Emily**: Well, when we say “I got the sack,” we mean I was fired. It means I can no longer work for that company or organization because of my bad work, my behavior, or something else. For example, she got the sack after 20 years of service, OR we can say her employer gave her the sack after 20 years of service.       
**Michael**: Oh, I hope no one gets the sack. Ok, Emily, what do we have next?     

**I was flabbergasted**       
**Emily**: The next expression is ‘I was flabbergasted.’        
**Michael**: And what does it mean?       
**Emily**: It means feeling shocked, usually because of something you were not expecting. For example, when they saw the list of their charges, they were completely flabbergasted.       
**Michael**: It happens to me a lot. How about you, dear English learners? Have you ever been flabbergasted?        
**Emily**: Do you want to explain our next expression, Mike?        

**Downsizing the employees**       
**Michael**: Of course. The next expression is ‘downsizing the employees’. It means reducing the size of the workforce and employees for different reasons. For example, this company may need to downsize its employees to protect its profits.     
**Emily**: Thank you. It was a good explanation.       

**To inquire about something**       
**Michael**: Now Emily, you said in the story, ‘Do you remember the time you inquired about your bonuses what did you mean by that?       
**Emily**: Well, actually inquire means to ask a question or to ask for information. And bonus means an extra amount of money that is given to you as a present or a reward for good work.       
**Michael**: So now I think it’s easy to guess the whole meaning.      
**Emily**: Yeah, now we can say ‘inquire about the bonus’ means ask for extra money. But don’t forget that the money is a kind of reward for your good work.     

**To turn somebody down**      
**Michael**: Perfect. Let’s move on to the next expression, which is ‘turn somebody down. Turn somebody down means to say ‘no’ to someone when they apply for something or offer something, Emily. It means to reject an offer made by someone.     
**Emily**: Yeah, for example, I thanked him for his offer but turned it down, OR I was turned down by lots of companies when I was just graduated and had no experience.       
**Michael**: And now, you dear learners, you tell us when the last time you turned down something in your life was? I mean, you rejected something in your life.      

**To take somebody on**        
**Emily**: The next expression is ‘to take somebody on.’ It means to employ someone.      
**Michael**: Oh, that’s very easy then.       
**Emily**: Yeah, for example, Microsoft Company took me on, or I was taken on by Microsoft Company.        
**Michael**: Now, you dear students, you answer us where would you like to be taken on?
