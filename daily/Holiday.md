_Dorothy and Jonathan are having a short conversation about visiting Rome. It appears that Dorothy is eager to visit there. Let’s listen to their conversation together._      
       
**Dorothy:** Hey Jonathan! Take a look at this scenic photo of Rome!     
**Jonathan:** Wow this is absolutely amazing! Rome’s truly home to some of the world’s wonderful sites!     
**Dorothy:** It really amazes me! I really wish to visit Rome one day.     
**Jonathan:** I’m sure your wish will come true in the future.     
**Dorothy:** Thank you Jon.     
      
**Jonathan:** Dorothy, I’d like to ask you some questions about a city you want to visit later. Tell me:    
• Where is it?     
• Why do you want to visit it?     
• What do you know about this city?     
 
I have a myriad of destinations on my must-visit list around the world. However, if I get the opportunity to choose one city, I would probably pick London, which is one of the most prominent capitals around the globe. I guess the reason why I desire to visit London has something to do with the fact that ever since I was a kid, I had always been amazed by the gorgeous and unique architecture of London. There are also some interesting facts about London that I want to witness in real life. One of them is the fact about the Big Ben tower. So far, many people see the tall clock tower and think that it’s Big Ben. But in fact, Big Ben is a giant thirteen-ton bell inside the tower that is rung every two hours by a two hundred-kilogram hammer. The real name of the Bell is the Great Bell of Westminster. Besides Big Ben, lots of tourists also enjoy visiting Buckingham Palace, which is also extremely appealing to me since it’s the home to the Queen of England. Watching the changing of the guard ceremony that takes place in front of the Palace’s gate certainly be exciting. Buckingham Palace is also the second-largest working palace in the world after Brunei’s Istana Nurul Iman. Many other elements are making London so tempting to me and pay this fantastic city a visit in the future. It is one of the items on my wish-list.      
       
It’s fall! All the things we love about this glorious season are back: colourful leaves, big orange pumpkins, apple cider and harvest festivals… to name just a few of our favourites. The travel and tourism landscape may be markedly different than it was this time last year, but we’re thankful that some things never change. Autumn in York Durham Headwaters has always been about experiencing the best of what the season has to offer, so what better time is there than now to plan a much-needed staycation? Our attractions and destinations have been hard at work to make day-trips and short, overnight stays in our region both a pleasurable and—most importantly—safe experience.      
Okay, so let’s put the obvious reason to take a staycation out front: it is generally agreed that distance and overseas travel is not such a good idea at the moment. The Canadian government officially advises that citizens and permanent residents avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada to limit the spread of COVID-19.      
That being said, there are many reasons to take a staycation other than “because there is no other option.” On the practicality side, you can actually save money. Taking advantage of a local attraction or getaway package doesn’t come with the additional cost of airfare, or food and accommodations for an extended period. Being close to where you live is undoubtedly lighter on the old bank account, and a few days is often enough to recharge and rejuvenate while you do something you love or something you’ve never experienced before. Also, vacations can be stressful. Think of the time you are sure to spend planning and packing for your long-distance getaway. And, let’s face it, coming back to all that stuff you left behind at home can wipe out the R&R you’ve accomplished while away. With a staycation, you can have that get-away-from-it-all feeling, without the stress of planning and packing to actually get away.       
These are two great reasons to take a staycation, of course, and there are lots more. But when it comes down to it, we think York Durham Headwaters is simply a spectacular place that everyone should see and experience… All right, so maybe we’re biased, but we’re not apologizing. We want to entice you to enjoy a staycation in our region because we know you are going to have a wonderful time with us. To help you with your staycation planning, we’ve put together a sample of just some of the packages and opportunities our YDH partners have to offer.
