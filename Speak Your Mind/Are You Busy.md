# Are You Busy?       
**Most people today claim to be extremely busy.But I wonder if they are really any busier than people who lived at other times.Maybe most people generally regard themselves as being busy even if they are not.No one wants to admit to idleness or laziness,not even to himself.It may also be that people are aware that there are so many possibilites of things to do that they feel compelled to do them all.**      
       
## What keeps you busy?      
(1) My job        
(2) Family concerns      
(3) Cultivating relationships with others      
(4) My kids      
(5) Efforts to improve the quality of my life      
(6) I just pretend to be busy      
        
## Sample answer      
On weekends,there always seems to be some sort of family obligation I have to attend.Someone is always having a birthday or anniversary or graduation or a wedding or other kind of family reunion.If nothing is scheduled and I think I will have some free time,it always seems like a family emergency occurs,so I never have time for myself.      
        
Children are not only expensive but time-consuming as well!Every day I have to make sure they are doing their homework.They participate in sports and other activities that I have to attend,too.But even without these obvious instances,they always need my personal love and attention on display.It wears me out.

## Who do you think are busier these days,men or women?       
**M**: As always,men are busier than women are.       
**F**: What!How can you say that?         
**M**: Maybe,at one time,"A woman's work is never done" was true.But these days,a woman can do all of her housework in a few hours and have lots of leisure time to shop and meet her friends before her husband and children get home.I wish I had a life that easy.     
**F**: You aren't a woman,and it's obvious you don't know what you're talking about.     
**M**: Obviously I'm not a femal,but that doesn't mean that I'm ignorant.    
**F**: The modern woman has to get up early in the morning,fix breakfast for her family,get her children ready for school,get herself dressed,go to work,spend a hard day on the job,come home,help kids with homework,do the housework,prepare supper,do the dishes,put the kids to bed,finish any work she has taken home with her from the office,deal with her husband's needs,and then finally go to sleep.And then,early in the next day,she starts the routine all over again.       
**M**: Nervertheless,I spend far more time at work than my wife does.Even after hours,I have to meet with clients to further the company's interests.     
**F**: You mean you go to fancy restaurants and expensive bars instead of going home and helping your wife.     
**M**: It may seem like fun to an outsider,but it's actually very stressful.I really just want to at home.      
**F**: Once a man's done with work,he's done!But a woman has to maintain two jobs,one at home and one outside the house.No wonder she gets old so fase.     
**M**: Oh,come on!Women outlive men by several years.I'm convinced that hard work shorten men's life,and the women get to save thier energy and live longer.      
**F**: No.But maybe women are so busy they aren't able to drink or smoke or overeat the way men do - it's those activities which kill them off,not the work!
